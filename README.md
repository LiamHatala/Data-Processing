# Data-Processing
Scripts Im writing to automate some data analysis jobs. 

Alarm_Time.py:
this file is used for calculating the time from when an alarm starts to when it is ok'ed. this would be done with an exported .csv file from the RTJ.

IO_LIST_COMBINE.py:
This file is used to combine exported IO channels from all the different IO cards connected to a controller. it combines them into one big list organized so that they can be processed all at once rather than one at a time.
